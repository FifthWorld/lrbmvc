                      covering all the 18 Local Government Areas in the State. The Bureau keeps and maintains the Land Register, where more than <strong>40 Thousand Titles </strong> 
                       – the evidence of ownership – are documented. Once land or property is entered in the register we record any ownership changes, mortgages or leases that affect it.
                        The world-class electronic system provides accessibility to Ondo State land records from any online location in the world.  Our goal is to put the customer, 
                       quality and innovation at the heart of land registration services..</p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">Prior to the creation of Ondo State from the old western state in 1976, the land registry transaction was administered by the Old Western
                         State land records. After the creation of the state, the activities were handed over to the Akure land registry. With the provisions of the Land instrument registration 
                        CAP 54 of the laws of Ondo State 1978 the registry was organized and placed under the department of land services of the ministry of lands and housing. </p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify"> With the need to move from the existing paper based method of land registry to digitized way of land registry, the Bureau was commissioned to 
                        enable registered users to conduct secure electronic title and survey transactions in real time, automating and speeding up traditional (and sometimes prolonged and complex) 
                        manual processes.  The LRB would modernize the way it records and manages land ownership and interest records. This system would guarantee to the owners of every converted property 
                        that they are actually the owners.</p>
